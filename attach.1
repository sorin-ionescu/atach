.SH NAME
\fBattach\fP \- a session manager for dtach

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBattach\fP [\fB-\fP\fIoption\fP \fI...\fP] [\fIsession\fP | [\fIcommand\fP
[\fIarguments\fP \fI...\fP]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBattach\fP is a session manager for dtach. If all you need is detachment and
attachment functionality, \fBscreen\fP(1) is overkill. Unfortunately, using
\fBdtach\fP(1) requires manual management of socket files. Let \fBattach\fP
manage dtach sessions (sockets) for you instead.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBattach\fP understands the following switches:
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-list
List sessions.
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-sockets
List sockets.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-session \fIname\fP
Set the session name. If it is not set, the name of the command will be used
instead.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-char \fIc\fP
Set the detach character (default: \fB^\\\fP).
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-redraw \fImethod\fP
Set the redraw method to \fBnone\fP, which disables redrawing, \fBctrl_l\fP
(default), which sends a Ctrl + L character if the terminal is in
character-at-a-time and no-echo modes, or \fBwinch\fP, which forces a SIGWINCH
signal to be sent to the program.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-detached
Start the session detached.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-no-detach
Disable detaching.
.TP
.B \-Z, \-\-no-suspend
Disable suspending.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Display version and copyright.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display help.
